# Game Smart Contract

![Admin Panel](../../img/game-smart-contract.mp4)

Developed & deployed a ERC1155 Smart Contract along with CMS/Admin panel to integrate with their game. The contract was designed to read from metadata from an off-chain database via a REST API. It also integrated with Google Cloud to allow the game server to securely communicate updates to players assets.
